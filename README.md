# obj_det_using_ros
I have done this project as an intern in qbotics lab 

INSTALLATION:

   ->Install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html)
  
   ->Install [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org)
   
   ->Download [Protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) and extract it
   
   ->Clone [cob_perception_common](https://github.com/ipa-rmb/cob_perception_common.git) so that we can import detection, detectionarray and rect
   
   ->Now you need to Clone or Download TensorFlow’s Model from Github. Once downloaded and extracted rename the “models-masters” to just “models“.
   
   And keep "models","protobuf" and "cob_perception_common" under one folder for simplicity.

After installation you can add the code in object_detection folder.
